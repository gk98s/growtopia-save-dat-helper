# How To Use

SETUP:

After installing the program, create a folder in your desktop. Open the program and click the settings icon. For the folder location, choose the folder you've just created. For the growtopia location, right click growtopia and click "Open File Location" and copy the path of that folder. And after you paste it in the growtopia location, you're good to go.

BUTTONS:

Save: This is the first button you'd want to use in order to save your save.dat file in the folder which you've just created. And if you make any changes in the options menu, you'd want to save in order to save the changes you've made.

Replace: This is what you'd want to use before you open the game.

Secure: Make sure you use this after you're done playing. As longer as the save.dat is secured save.dat stealers won't be able to steal your save.dat
